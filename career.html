                    <p>There are distinct and important goals of software engineering. Everyone designing, developing, testing, or maintaining software and/or application portfolios need to ensure that their software is:</p>

                <p>Within the next 6 month I will try to get a new job. I am really working for a great company with a great work-life balance, many opportunities to develop my skills and work on interesting topics.I will improve my python and java skills. I will also improve my data structure/ algorithm knowledge.</p>
                <p>Within the next 1 year I have to greatly improve problem solving skill and speed through applied algorithms and will try to use time more efficiently on weekends for more coding.</p>
                <p>I have no really fixed plans for the time after one year. I have taken into consideration to launch an own webside which might be something I could build a startup from. I'm also planning to develope large scale distributed systems.</p>
